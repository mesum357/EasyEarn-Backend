DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED

Changes made:
- Added 'url' field to Task schema in backend/app.js
- This fixes the issue where task URLs were not being saved when created from admin panel

To deploy:
1. Commit and push these changes to the repository
2. Railway will automatically redeploy the backend
3. The URL field will then work properly for new tasks

Test after deployment:
- Create a new task from admin panel with a URL
- Verify the URL appears in the frontend task page
