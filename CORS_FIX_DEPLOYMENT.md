# CORS Fix Deployment

## Changes Made

### Backend (app.js)
1. **Enhanced CORS Configuration**: Added detailed logging to track CORS requests
2. **Fallback CORS Headers**: Added middleware to ensure CORS headers are always set
3. **Debug Endpoints**: Added `/api/test-cors` endpoint for testing
4. **Admin Route Logging**: Added logging to all admin routes for debugging

### Admin Panel
1. **Centralized Axios Client**: Created `lib/axios.ts` with proper configuration
2. **Updated Components**: Replaced direct axios calls with the configured client
3. **Test Page**: Added `/test-cors` page for testing CORS functionality
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Added request/response interceptors for debugging

## Key Fixes

### CORS Configuration
- Added detailed logging to track which origins are being allowed/blocked
- Added fallback middleware to ensure CORS headers are always set
- Enhanced error handling for CORS issues

### API Client Configuration
- Created centralized axios client with `withCredentials: true`
- Added proper headers for CORS requests
- Added request/response interceptors for debugging

## Testing

1. **Test CORS Connection**: Visit `/test-cors` in admin panel
2. **Check Console Logs**: Monitor backend logs for CORS debugging
3. **Verify Admin Routes**: Test dashboard, deposits, notifications, users

## Deployment Steps

1. Deploy backend changes to Railway
2. Deploy admin panel changes to Railway
3. Test CORS functionality using the test page
4. Monitor logs for any remaining issues

## Expected Results

- CORS errors should be resolved
- Admin panel should be able to fetch data from backend
- Console logs should show successful CORS requests
- All admin functionality should work properly
