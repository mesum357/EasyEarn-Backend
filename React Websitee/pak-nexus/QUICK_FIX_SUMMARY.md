# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Image Persistence Issue

## The Problem
Your images disappear after each Railway deployment because Railway's file system is ephemeral.

## The Solution
I've implemented Cloudinary integration to store images in the cloud instead of locally.

## What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW:

### 1. Create Cloudinary Account
- Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
- Sign up for free account
- Get your credentials (Cloud Name, API Key, API Secret)

### 2. Add Environment Variables to Railway
In your Railway backend environment variables, add:
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

### 3. Deploy the Updated Code
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix image persistence with Cloudinary"
git push
```

## What's Fixed:
- ✅ New uploads will use Cloudinary (persistent)
- ✅ Images won't disappear on deployments
- ✅ Automatic image optimization
- ✅ CDN for faster loading

## What's Not Fixed Yet:
- ⚠️ Existing images in database still reference local paths
- 🔄 Migration script available to convert existing images

## Test the Fix:
1. Deploy the code
2. Upload a new image
3. Deploy again (any small change)
4. Check if the image still appears ✅

## Files Changed:
- `backend/middleware/cloudinary.js` - New Cloudinary middleware
- `backend/routes/institute.js` - Updated to use Cloudinary URLs
- `backend/utils/imageMigration.js` - Migration utilities
- `backend/scripts/migrateImages.js` - Migration script

**This will permanently solve your image persistence issue!** 🎉
