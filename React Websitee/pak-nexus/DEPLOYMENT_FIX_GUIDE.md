# 🚨 CRITICAL: Fix Image Persistence Issue on Railway

## Problem
Your images are disappearing after each deployment because Railway's file system is ephemeral. When you push new code, all uploaded images in the `uploads/` directory are lost.

## ✅ Solution: Cloudinary Integration

I've implemented Cloudinary to solve this issue permanently.

### Step 1: Set Up Cloudinary Account
1. Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Create a free account
3. Get your credentials from the dashboard:
   - Cloud Name
   - API Key
   - API Secret

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Railway
Add these to your Railway backend environment variables:

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

### Step 3: Deploy the Updated Code
The code has been updated to use Cloudinary. Deploy to Railway:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix image persistence with Cloudinary"
git push
```

### Step 4: Migrate Existing Images (Optional)
If you want to migrate existing images from your database:

1. **Download your current uploads folder** from Railway (if possible)
2. **Run the migration script** (after setting up Cloudinary):

```bash
cd backend
node scripts/migrateImages.js
```

## What's Changed

### ✅ Backend Updates
- ✅ New Cloudinary middleware (`backend/middleware/cloudinary.js`)
- ✅ Updated institute routes to use Cloudinary URLs
- ✅ Migration utilities for existing images
- ✅ Environment variable configuration

### ✅ Benefits
- ✅ **Images persist between deployments**
- ✅ **Automatic image optimization**
- ✅ **CDN for faster loading**
- ✅ **Free tier: 25GB storage**
- ✅ **Automatic image transformations**

## Alternative Solutions

If you prefer not to use Cloudinary:

### Option 1: AWS S3
```bash
npm install aws-sdk multer-s3
```

### Option 2: Google Cloud Storage
```bash
npm install @google-cloud/storage multer-gcs
```

### Option 3: Railway Volumes (Limited)
Railway offers persistent volumes, but they're more complex to set up.

## Testing the Fix

1. **Deploy the updated code**
2. **Upload a new image** through your app
3. **Deploy again** (push any small change)
4. **Check if the image still appears** ✅

## Migration Status

- ✅ **New uploads**: Will use Cloudinary
- ⚠️ **Existing images**: Still reference local paths
- 🔄 **Migration script**: Available to convert existing images

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Cloudinary account**
2. **Add environment variables to Railway**
3. **Deploy the updated code**
4. **Test with new image uploads**
5. **Run migration script** (optional, for existing images)

## Support
